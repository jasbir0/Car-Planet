“CAR RENTAL WEBSITE” has been developed on HTML,CSS,Javascript and MySQL database and it runs over the 
Apache Server, WAMP Server or XAMP Server. "If your business is not on the internet, then your business will be 
out of business" CAR RENTAL SYSTEM (CRS) is a web-based system for a company that rents out cars. This 
system enables the company to make their services available to the public through the internet and also keep 
records about their services. An online car rental system allows a person to book/reserve a vehicle with/without 
payment on one end while the company staff handles the transactions, on the other via the Internet.
This includes study on how the car rental business is being done, process involved and opportunity that exist for 
improvement. PHP Technology used for the development of the application. General customers as well as the 
company’s staff will be able to use the system effectively. Web-platform means that the system will be available 
for access 24/7 except when there is a temporary server issue which is expected to be minimal.
